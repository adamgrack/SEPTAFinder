For this project my approach was to take each element of the end product and create it separately. I haven't used Python outside of university classes, so I was 
unsure of how to go about most of this. My initial approach was defining the main goal, getting a nearby SEPTA station, so I started with creating SEPTAFinder, and 
created helper functions from there. As I have not used Python much, there was a lot of time spent looking up basic syntax and learning about things such as conda.
In addition to learning the basics again, I needed to learn about the geospatial libraries, so GeoPandas' documentation was important for me to learn how to parse
the GeoDataFrames correctly. Setting up API calls was fairly simple and straight forward after I found Flask, and then there was a quick rundown of old HTML skills
that I haven't used since university as well.

In terms of how this would be deployed, I believe this would be best deployed as a single service as I have written it. The SEPTAFinder.py acts as a pseudo library,
but references local data in my Data folder. I would like to deploy using a cloud computing instance, such as AWS's EC2, and from there set up user restrictions with
their security group functionality on the instance. To make it accessible to a large number of people I would set up an auto scaling group with an application 
balancer in front to distribute the load across instances. Since I would use AWS, there comes built in usage metrics that can be monitored and set to alert for 
activity thresholds.
